            <ol>
             <b><li>What is peeK?</li></b>
             <p>peeK is a facial recognition door lock system.<p>
             <b><li>Facial Recognition? That sounds complicated. I'm not a tech savvy person, how hard is it to setup everything?</li></b>
             <p>It is, but not for our users. After the initial setup process (3 minutes) it takes just seconds to unlock your door with nothing but your face.
             <p>We tried to make the setup as quick and easy as it should be. Just choose 6 pictures of your face to be uploaded and hit the enroll button.</p>
             <b><li>I have my house created and my face enrolled, now what?</li></b>
             <p>Using peeK is as easy as taking a selfie, just click on unlock, snap a selfie and press go!</p>
             <b><li>So I can unlock my house, what if I leave and forget to lock it?</li></b>
             <p>Easy! Just log into your dashboard from any computer or phone and hit the lock icon...Done!</p>
             <b><li>Does peeK work with my current smartlock</li></b>
             <p>We are working to implement peeK recipes into IFTTT.com, allowing you to add facial recognition security to smartlocks such as August and Kwikset Kevo. </p>
             <b><li>Does peeK work with my phone?</li></b>
             <p>Yes, you can login to peek.cf from any iOS or Android device that has a front-facing camera. We are also available on the Apple APP STORE with a standalone iOS app for easy access.</p>
